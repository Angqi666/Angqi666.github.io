## Abstract
Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are essential for neuroscience research but often contain noise and artifacts. This paper introduces a novel approach to EEG artifact removal utilizing diffusion models. Leveraging principles of diffusion, our method offers a promising avenue for denoising EEG signals while maintaining signal fidelity. In contrast to deep learning techniques, our approach exhibits the advantage of requiring minimal labeled data and computational resources. Traditional methods for EEG artifact removal often resort to linear filtering or manual artifact rejection, which may not sufficiently address the complexities of non-stationary noise sources. Our method remove the artifacts from brain activity, thereby enhancing EEG signal quality. Experimental evaluation on generate noisy EEG datasets with different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) show efficacy of our approach, suggesting its potential contribution to the advancement of neuroscientific inquiry.
   
## Dataset - Data Blending

The contaminated signals can be generated by linearly mixing the pure EEG segments with EOG artifact segments

## Results 

* Proposed method shows consistent performance across 5 metrics with lower deviation.

* MAD surpasses state-of-the-art overall, but notably improves for higher SNR EEG data (-7 to -5).

* RRMSE_S indicates potential for enhancement due to slightly elevated errors.
